# Basic manual test flow cases

This document contains a set of different cases regarding `Gapminder Offline` manual testing including auto update functionality.

## Check if Windows un-installer works properly

1\. Download the app from the following links (for appropriate platform):

  [v4.1.0 64 bit](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gapminder-offline/4.1.0/Install%20Gapminder%20Offline-64.exe)
  or [v4.1.0 32 bit](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gapminder-offline/4.1.0/Install%20Gapminder%20Offline-32.exe)

2\. Run the installer app

3\. install v4.0.1 to the `C:\Program Files`

7\. Choose "Uninstall Gapminder Tools Offline" button

8\. install 5.0.0

   * [link for download GP 5.0.0](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gapminder-offline/dist/Gapminder+Tools+Offline+Setup+5.0.0.exe)

9\. Close the app

10\. Open the "Start" menu

11\. Find and click on the "Gapminder Tools Offline" folder

12\. Choose "Uninstall Gapminder Tools Offline" button

![screen](https://github.com/Gapminder/gapminder-offline/blob/feat-docs-manual-test-flow/docs/manual-test-flow-screenshots/Uninstall%205.0.jpg?raw=true)

***Expected Result:*** After uninstall v5.0.0 , `Gapminder Tools Offline` folder in the `C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming` folder must be missing.

## Checking for `update dataset` and `update the app`

Note: first of all, this option is unavailable on Linux by the following technical reason [AppImage specific](https://appimage.org/)

1\. Download the app from the following link: [v5.0.0 for Windows](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gapminder-offline/dist/Gapminder+Tools+Offline+Setup+5.0.0.exe)

2\. Switch off the internet

3\. Run downloaded executable file

4\. Install the app

5\. Check for alert message regarding new version, it should NOT be raised

6\. Close the app

7\. Downgrade the dataset inside the app:

   * open `datapackage.json` in the dataset folder (`C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Gapminder Tools Offline\resources\ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis\datapackage.json`. Important note: path above will be a little bit different on MacOS)
   * change version in `datapackage.json` to another version less than 1.16.1 (1.16.0, for example)

![screen](https://github.com/Gapminder/gapminder-offline/blob/feat-docs-manual-test-flow/docs/manual-test-flow-screenshots/change-ds-version.jpg?raw=true)

   * run the app

8\. check the dataset version (should be 1.16.0)

9\. switch on internet

10\. open the app

11\. click the "update now" button in the top right corner of the app

12\. update 5.0.0 to 6.0.0 (ds update message should NOT be raised)

13\. 6.0.0 should contain actual dataset itself

14\. downgrade ds on 6.0.0

   * open `datapackage.json` file in the dataset folder (`C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Gapminder Tools Offline\resources\ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis\datapackage.json`. Important note: path above will be a little bit different on MacOS)
   * change version in dataset datapackage to someone less than 1.16.1 (to 1.16.0, for example)

15\. open the app

16\. click to the button on the top right corner for update dataset

17\. Open the "Start" menu

18\. Find and click on the "Gapminder Tools Offline" folder

19\. Choose "Uninstall Gapminder Tools Offline" button


## How to use test auto-update functionality locally (without AWS S3 storage)

1\. Setup the project

2\. Change in the electron-builder.json, "publish" block:

```
"publish": [
      {
        "provider": "generic",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
      }
    ],
```

> Never commit this changes!!!

3\. Change the version of the app in the `package.json` from "version": "5.0.0" to upper version ("6.0.0, for example"),

4\. Build the v6.0.0 of the app

5\. Create a folder (v6.0.0 for example) out of the project folder

6\. Open Bash in the created folder and use `npm i -g http-server` command

7\. After `http-server` installed, run `http-server` command in the directory that contains v.6.0.0

8\. Move all files from the "app-build" folder to the "v6.0.0" folder

9\. Downgrade the version of the app in the "package.json" from "version": "6.0.0" to "version": "5.0.0"

10\. Build the v5.0.0 of the app

11\. Setup the "Gapminder Tools Offline Setup 5.0.0"

12\. Run the app

13\. Pay attention to the top right corner

14\. The message "New version 6.0.0 is available!" appeared

## How to run the all from MacOS console

Typically you can find `Gapminder Offline` here: `/Applications/Gapminder Offline.app`.

Run the following command if you want to run the app from terminal:
`/Applications/Gapminder Offline.app/Contents/MacOS/gapminder-offline`

More info [here](https://www.macissues.com/2015/02/06/how-to-launch-os-x-apps-via-the-terminal/)

This kind of start of the app is actual in case if you want to pass specific arguments to the app. For example: `/Applications/Gapminder Offline.app/Contents/MacOS/gapminder-offline dev` when you want to show `Developer Console` immediately after start.
